# Dicee Application ðŸŽ²

## The Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce me to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I will build in the future. This app will teach me how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.

## What I will create

I will be making a Las Vegas dice app. This will make the die roll at the press of a button.

## What I will learn

- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- How to change the properties of various widgets.
- How to use onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- How to use Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Understand and use string interpolation.
- Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- Code and use gesture controls.
